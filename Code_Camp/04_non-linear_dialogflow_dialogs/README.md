# Use input and output contexts in Dialogflow

Some intents need a certain context to be valid. E.g. if the user asks for a rerouting of a parcel you could require a context containing information about the parcel for the intent to be a valid possibility. You would not expect a user to ask for rerouting if he did not ask for the current status before.

1. Add outgoing context at "Parcel Status" intent, name it "parcel" and leave the default 5 minute lifespan as it is.

2. Create a new intent "Reroute Parcel" and require the parcel context you just created as input context.

3. Define a location parameter, make it required and choose `@sys.location` as entity. See the [Dialogflow documentation](https://dialogflow.com/docs/reference/system-entities) for more information about system entities.

4. Define a response like "Alright, we will reroute your parcel with the id #parcel.parcel_id to \$location!", note that you can access `#parcel.parcel_id` from your input context.
