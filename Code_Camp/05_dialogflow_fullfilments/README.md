# Use input and output contexts in Dialogflow

Often you need to retrieve information from your database or a service in order to provide a full user response. E.g. if you have to ask your service the parcel's estimated arrival time. For this use case Dialogflow allows webhooks.

1. Deploy a new webhook! Similar to task 1, replace the `<your_prefix>` tag at the `package.json.template` and rename the file to `package.json`. Run `npm install` and `npm run create`. Study the provided example code for this task!

2. Add a Fulfillment at Dialogflow and enter the URL of the lambda you just created. See `npm run create` console output for URL. Choose "Enable for all Domains".

3. Switch to the Parcel Status intent you created previously, enable "Enable webhook call for this intent" and "Enable webhook call for slot filling".

4. Use the user's query parameters, e.g. parcel_id, to read status from DynamoDB and return it. Find the parameters at `const parameters = objectPath.get(req, 'body.result.parameters')`. See TODO at `index.js` for more detailed task description.

5. Resolve with an event to Dialogflow!

```
{
    followupEventInput: {
        parameters: {
            parcel_id: parameters.parcel_id,
            status'<status>'
        },
        name: 'fill_parcel_status'
    }
}
```

6. Listen to event inside your intent, by creating an event at "Events" at your Parcel Status intent, name it `fill_parcel_status`.

7. Add a new parameter "status" and define `#fill_parcel_status.status` as value. Also define `#fill_parcel_status.parcel_id` as default value for the parameter "parcel_id".

8. Use returned status in bot answer by defining "The parcel with the id $parcel_id will arrive $status!"
